<p>The National Hot Rod Association, or NHRA, is the pinnacle of the sport of drag  racing. There are many variations of the NHRA, but they all
  have to follow the NHRA rule book and they all have one thing in common, and that is the desire to go fast!!

     <h1><center> Los Angeles Lakers logo</center></h1>
<h2> How it all started....</h1>
<p>This franchise started with the purchase of a disbanded team in 1947, the Detroit Gems. The new team
  began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, their new name was the "Minneapolis Lakers" due to their state's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes".
  Initially a member of the National Basketbal League (NBL), the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the Basketball
  Association of America(BAA) and
  winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949. The team was led by their center George
  Mikan, who is described by the NBA's official website as the league's "first superstar". After a financial struggle in the late 1950s
  following Mikan's retirement, they moved to Los Angeles before the 1960â€“61 season.
